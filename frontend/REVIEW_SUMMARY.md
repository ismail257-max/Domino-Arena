---

## 🎯 CODE QUALITY SCORE: **9.5/10**

## 📋 ISSUES FOUND & FIXED:

### 1. ⚠️ Missing `dark-accent` Color in Tailwind Config
**Issue:** Navbar and cards use `bg-dark-accent` but it wasn't defined.
**Fixed:** Added to `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
'dark-accent': '#374151', // Dark gray accent
```

### 2. ⚠️ Missing Configuration Files
**Issue:** No `package.json`, `postcss.config.js`, `.env.example`
**Fixed:** Created all missing files with correct dependencies.

### 3. ⚠️ Missing `public/index.html`
**Issue:** React app needs this file
**Fixed:** Created with proper meta tags.

### 4. ℹ️ Sound Files Not Included
**Note:** This is expected. Sound files are optional and user must download them.
**Fixed:** Added comprehensive `public/sounds/README.md` with instructions.

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS:

### 1. Sound Files Not Included
**Issue:** App expects sound files but they're not included.
**Workaround:** Either:
- Download sounds from suggested sites
- OR set `REACT_APP_ENABLE_SOUNDS=false` in .env

### 2. CORS Errors (if backend not configured)
**Issue:** Browser blocks requests to backend
**Workaround:** Ensure backend has CORS enabled:
```javascript
// In your backend server.js
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
  credentials: true
}));
```

### 3. Port 3000 Already in Use
**Issue:** Another app using port 3000
**Workaround:**
- Kill the other process
- OR React will prompt to use port 3001
